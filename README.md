Using typography to create an energy drink website

 The company behind this website sells energy drinks. On this website, colour and font are the main design elements. I utilised vivid colours to make the website pop, and I used large, bold typography to make it immediately noticeable when you open it. For this code, I primarily utilised CSS and HTML, and I used containers to hold all the text and images in the page's middle.# Project1-main
